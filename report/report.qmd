# Introduction

This is example of a report. Here is a citation to R [@Rcore] and Latex
[@Lamport1986]. Here is a code chunk.

```{r}
x = rnorm(100)
hist(x)
head(x, 20)
```

Now $\vec{x} = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ is a vector.

Some customizations are:

1. Add a bibliography.
1. Set the title/header font to serif to match the content.
1. Set the dimensions.
1. Add a footnote with the compile time, package version, and contact information.
1. Set the style of code displays.
1. Redefine Latex `\vec{...}` to make symbols bold.
